What am I supposed to do with this time
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm
Feel out of control, so petrified
I'm petrified

What am I supposed to do to get by
Did I loose everything I need to survive
Cause it's 4am and the sweats sets in
Did you get my message, did it send
Or did you just get on with your life, oh

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and runaway, runaway

What am I supposed to do with these clothes
It's my twisted way of keep you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message, did it send
Or do you get along on your own, oh

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and runaway, runaway

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to

Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
