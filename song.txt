What am I supposed to do with this time
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm
Feel out of control, so petrified
I'm petrified

What am I supposed to do to get by
Did I loose everything I need to survive
Cause it's 4am and the sweats sets in
Did you get my message, did it send
Or did you just get on with your life, oh
